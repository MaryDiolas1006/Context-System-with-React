## CONTEXT SYSTEM WITH REACT
- *Context System*, Gets data from a parent component to *any* nested child   
   component. It's slightly the same with the `Props System`. The difference 
   is; `Props System`, gets data from parent component to a *direct* child
   component. 
- *Context System* is all about `communication data/information`.
